## Recent Changes

- **Separate `iLvl` and `GS` columns** — The old GS field is now labeled `iLvl`, and a new `GS` column tracks actual GearScore.
- **Actual GearScore calculation** — Inspect now calculates WotLK-style GearScore from equipped gear instead of reusing average item level.
- **Shared score syncing** — `iLvl` and `GS` stay in sync across Class, All, and Raid tabs, including copy/paste and drag reorder paths.
- **Addon code split into modules** — Shared bootstrap, data tables, layout constants, needs helpers, and raid row refresh logic now live in separate Lua files loaded by the TOC.
- **All tab action fixes** — Delete, add-to-group, and add-to-raid actions now operate on the visible character.
- **Deletion cleanup** — Removing a character also clears matching needs and raid roster references.
- **Invite flow fixes** — Invite buttons now reflect whether you are inviting a raid, inviting a group, or have an active invite run.
- **Raid size normalization** — Raid rosters now initialize and clamp correctly for the selected size.
- **Needs system** — Up to 2 needed gear slots per character, editable across Class, All, and Raid tabs.

## Features

### Class Tabs

Each of the 10 playable classes has its own tab with up to 54 roster slots across 3 pages. Each character row tracks:

- Row number — muted grey, turns gold on hover
- Spec icon — auto-detected from talent inspection
- Name — editable, colored by class
- iLvl — average equipped item level calculated via inspect
- Gear Score — actual WotLK-style GearScore calculated from inspected gear
- **Needs** — up to 2 gear slots marked as needed, shown as slot icons
- 17 gear slots — Head, Neck, Shoulders, Back, Chest, Wrists, Hands, Waist, Legs, Feet, Ring 1, Ring 2, Trinket 1, Trinket 2, Main Hand, Off Hand, Ranged
- Add to Raid (+) and Invite to Group (>) buttons per row
- Hover any gear slot to see the full item tooltip

### Sort & Page

Every tab has a Sort dropdown (top-left) and Page dropdown (top-right). Sort options: By Name, By Class/Spec, By Gear Score. Gear Score sorting uses the true `GS` column. After dragging to reorder, sort mode clears so your order sticks.

### Bottom Controls (Class Tabs)

- **+ Add Target** — Inspects your current target and adds them
- **+ Add Group** — Bulk-adds all group/raid members
- **+ Add Target/Group GS** — Refreshes both `iLvl` and `GS` from inspect (does not affect spec)
- **+ Add Target/Group Spec** — Reads talent spec (does not affect GS)
- **Stop** — Cancels a running GS or Spec scan
- **Maintenance** — Sends maintenance to group chat
- **AutoGear** — Sends autogear to group chat
- **Login/Logout All Bots** — `.playerbots bot add/remove *`
- **Disband Group / Raid** — Kicks all members then leaves. Requires confirmation
- **Invite Raid / Stop Invite** — Visible on all tabs

### Summary Bars

- **Avg bar** — average tracked item level per class, class name in class color, value in gold
- **Count bar** — total characters per class

---

## Needs System

Per-character gear slot wishlist, accessible from all tabs.

- 15 selectable slots: Head, Neck, Shoulders, Back, Chest, Wrists, Hands, Waist, Legs, Feet, Ring, Trinket, Main Hand, Off Hand, Ranged
- Max 2 needs per character
- Click a Needs cell to open the picker popup
- Left-click a slot icon to mark as needed, right-click to remove
- Once at max (2), remaining slots are dimmed
- Right-click the Needs cell itself to clear all needs for that character
- Changes sync instantly across Class, All, and Raid tabs
- Stored in `LichborneTrackerDB.needs` per character name

---

## Raid Tab

Up to 40 slots across two columns. Each slot shows class icon, spec icon, name, `iLvl`, `GS`, needs, role, notes, and delete button.

### Raid Controls

- **Sort** — By Name, Class/Spec, or Gear Score using the real `GS` value
- **Tier / Raid / Group dropdowns** — Tier color matches raid name color
- **Copy** — Copies current roster to session clipboard
- **Paste** — Prompts confirmation, pastes into destination, disappears after one use
- **Clear** — Clears roster with confirmation

### Copy / Paste

1. Navigate to source roster → click **Copy**
2. Navigate to destination → click **Paste**
3. Confirm: *"Copy T1 Molten Core (A) roster to T3 Karazhan (B)?"*
4. Status bar shows "Roster copied!"

Clipboard is session-only. Paste respects destination raid size — a 10-man paste from a 40-man only fills 10 slots.

### Invite Raid

Automatically logs out old bots, leaves party, converts to raid, and invites all roster members via `.playerbots bot add`.

---

## Character Sheet (All Tab)

Master view of all tracked characters across all classes — 3 columns of 20 rows (60 per page, 180 total).

- Groups A, B, C for organizing characters
- Sort by Name, Class/Spec, or Gear Score using the real `GS` value
- Needs column editable per row
- Add to Raid and Invite to Group buttons per row
- Delete characters directly
- Count bar shows totals across all pages

---

To share data between accounts, copy:

```text
WoW/WTF/Account/ACCOUNTNAME/SavedVariables/LichborneTracker.lua
```

## Code Organization

The addon still loads through `LichborneTracker.toc`, but the shared logic is no longer concentrated in one large file.

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `LichborneTracker/Core.lua` | Saved-variable bootstrap, legacy migration, raid roster access |
| `LichborneTracker/Layout.lua` | Shared layout constants and column sizing |
| `LichborneTracker/Data.lua` | Static lookup tables for specs, classes, tiers, roles, and raid labels |
| `LichborneTracker/GearScore.lua` | WotLK-style GearScore calculation helpers |
| `LichborneTracker/Needs.lua` | Needs data helpers and limits |
| `LichborneTracker/Helpers.lua` | Shared row, tab, and tracker helper functions |
| `LichborneTracker/NeedsUI.lua` | Needs picker and needs-cell UI behavior |
| `LichborneTracker/RaidRows.lua` | Raid roster sorting and refresh behavior |
| `LichborneTracker/LichborneTracker.lua` | Remaining frame construction, event wiring, and top-level addon flow |

---

## Known Limitations

- Inspect requires target within ~28 yards
- GearScore depends on the inspect data returned by the server for the target's equipped items
- `NotifyInspect()` is rate-limited — bulk scans space out automatically
- Playerbot commands sent via SAY chat — requires bot ownership
- Roster clipboard is session-only (lost on `/reload`)

---

## Slash Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/lichborne` | Toggle the tracker window |
| `/lbt` | Toggle the tracker window (short alias) |
